# ABCJS editor demo

This demo uses a simple `contenteditable` element so you can mix normal text with music rendered by [abcjs](https://abcjs.net/). Click **Insert ABC** to open a modal with an input area and live preview. After inserting, the notation is added as an inline SVG image. Use **Export HTML** to download the current contents of the editor.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
