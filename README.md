# wangeditor abcjs demo

This project demonstrates how to add an **ABC notation** button to [wangEditor](https://www.wangeditor.com/) using React and TypeScript. Clicking the button opens a dialog where you can type ABC notation on the left and preview it rendered by [abcjs](https://abcjs.net/) on the right. When you click **Insert**, the notation is converted to an inline SVG image and inserted into the editor at full width.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
